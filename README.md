# Front End MenuGG Panel (React Typescript)

Hi, I am currently working on my personal Fullstack CMS (React, Typescript, ExpressJS, Sequelize, PostgreSQL) project called MenuGG Panel. You can check it out live at [https://menugg-cms.vercel.app/](https://menugg-cms.vercel.app/).

For the backend, you can [check it out here](https://github.com/raflij/api-menugg-backend)

This project is a continuation of my previous work on [MenuGG (Digital Menu Paperless)](https://menugg-cms.vercel.app/) that I have already completed.

In the previous project, I focused solely on the frontend. However, in this iteration, I intend to establish a connection to a database and create a Content Management System.

## In this project, I have planned several features for MenuGG Panel:
- Authentication (Done...)
- Analytics (Coming soon)
- Restaurant Management (On Progres...)
- Menu Management (On Progres...)
- Upgrade Plan (On Progres...)

Stay tuned to get updates about this awesome project.
